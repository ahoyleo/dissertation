\acknowledge{Toward my many mentors I feel the deepest gratitude and respect. In particular, I acknowledge the tireless support of my research advisor, Dr. Dejing Dou, who provided guidance to me through all the steps that led to this dissertation. I also sincerely thank the Computer and Information Science (CIS) faculty, staff and my committee members for their time, encouragement, instruction and support.  I have fond remembrances of my assistantships on the Neural ElectroMagnetic Ontologies (NEMO) projects and I thank those colleagues for wonderful experiences.

I humbly acknowledge the funding support of the CIS department, Dr. Dejing Dou, and NEMO during my studies.

I would like to finally thank my parents and family for giving me the opportunity to fulfil my dreams and support to achieve my ambitions. Without them this work would not have been concluded.}

%Looks good.  My recommendation is that you do name Dejing in the last sentence and that you change "everything in general" to something more like "their time, encouragement, instruction and support" in the second sentence.  Then delete "specifically" at the end of the second sentence.
